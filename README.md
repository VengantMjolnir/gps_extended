# gps_extended
This is a simple mod designed to do one thing, add a GPS marker at a specified distance.

Have you ever found yourself wanting to mark something in the distance? An asteroid you want to check out but aren't quite ready? Is your sense of direction in space bad enough that when you spin around you can't find the thing you were looking at before?

This might be for you. Use it with /xgps <distance> <name>

Distance is in Kilometres and the name can be whatever you want. An example:

/xgps 2.5 An Asteroid I want to visit

That will put a marker 2.5km away with the name 'An Asteroid I want to visit'

This doesn't do anything else! No raycasts, no other adjustments. It does however ADD GPS points using the normal method, which does involve a server request for dedicated servers and shared worlds. Note this request originates on the client and is no different than using /gps or adding one through the menu.
